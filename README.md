### Built With

I used two packages that helped us to achieve our goals.

* [EmojiPicker](https://github.com/Kelvas09/EmojiPicker) -- It allows us to get a list of all the emojis as we don't have time to create our custom emoji picker
* [SwiftSunburstDiagram](https://github.com/lludo/SwiftSunburstDiagram) -- Sunburst diagram is a library written with SwiftUI to easily render diagrams given a tree of objects.
